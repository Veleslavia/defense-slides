						The complementary relationship between audio and video data drives multimodal studies across
						various domains and problems. Within that scope, we emphasise the important role that visual
						modality plays in music perception and conduct a study on multimodal data fusion techniques in
						the music information retrieval domain. In this talk, we outline challenges in audio-visual
						music information retrieval and present our work that addresses instrument classification and
						source separation problems in musical instrument performances. We discuss the efficiency of
						conditioning techniques being applied at different levels of a primary network and make use of
						two extra modalities of data, namely instrument labels and the corresponding visual stream data.

						So, what is audio-visual learning and why should you care about it? (Don't trust me, maybe we
						should not care about it at all).
						First of all, we should care about AV methods because neither machine perception nor human
						perception is perfect and  while machine perception is trying to mimic human perception sometimes with success,
						many problems remain open, especially for complex scenes that involve several perception channels.
						Music one such phenomenon, it's multimodal by nature from real-life performance to modern music videos.
						And once we try to analize it, we focus on the following tasks:

						how many could hear the difference? The overlap is so strong that it's almoust impossible without

						Just keep it in mind for a little, while I'm continue to introduce the task which we're trying to solve.
						Having a single-channel recording of a musical performance, that is to say a mixture of many possibly overlapping signals, we want to estimate their individual tracks, their sources.
						It can be used for hearing aid, music production, music education, as a preprocessing for other analysis tasks and so on.
						Here is an illustration of our goal.

						Now I would like to shortly discuss the common approach to solve this problem and why it is difficult to solve.
						One of the problems is that sources often overlap and time and frequency. It's especially true for instruments playing in harmony and in unison, this is often the case for classical music. And this is also a problem for instruments of the same family, since they have very similar timbre as well. 
						
						It has been shown that the complexity of the task increases with the number of sources, and in our work we tackle the problem not of just two-channel source separation, but we address multiple instrument separation where actual number of sources is not known.

						For many years standard common approach for this task had consisted in estimating binary or ratio masks which could be applied to a magnitude of mixture spectrogram in order to obtain the magnitude spectrogram of the sources, and then recostruct the original sound using either the mixture phase of phase-reconstruction algorithm.
						Thus we lose some information which can be potentially usefull for source separation and this is our primary motivation for waveform domain source separation.

						On the other hand, with all this complexity and the first example I've shown you in mind, we want to answer another question:

						So we took week information, which is instrument labels information which can be available from another classifier network from taken from a different modality, a decided to use them to condition our model.

						Let me briefly explain the architecture.
						Overall, in deep learning based source separation, there is a huge variety of architecture design. 
						All that start from an encoder-decoder architecture (but STFT-based), when people started to use U-net with skip connections but also STFT-based,
						then Wave-U-Net appeared, and we inhereted Wave-U-Net model from their authors. 
						But, first of all, we are trying to estimated multiple sources which are very sparce, and, finally,
						we apply a feature modulation with instrument labels on the bottleneck of the U-Net.

						It's multiplicative conditioning, because back then the authors weren't aware of FiLM. We only applied it to the bottleneck although later we tried other combinations.
